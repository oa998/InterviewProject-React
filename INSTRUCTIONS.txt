TODO:

Now that you have endpoints in the Spring Boot project that talks to the Database, we
have one more mandatory piece of functionality to add: the user needs to see all staff.
But only show the fields/columns for those staff as specified by the user.

The user will select the fields they desire to see. Process their inputs, get the data
from a new or existing Spring Boot endpoint, then show the data using the components already
provided in this project.

There are several ways to accomplish this. Talk through one or more ways to give the user
the functionality they want.  What are the pros/cons of each approach?

____ BONUS:

Add a text-box input to form. This input will accept only positive integers. This number
will be an input for a staff's ID number in the database table.  When the user presses the
"Show Selected" button, if there is an ID in the input box, find the user with that ID.
Still only show the columns selected via the checkboxes. If no user was found with that ID,
show an alert message indicating so.
